# Predictive analysis 
This project applies predictive analytics and machine learning using SAS Viya to assess and forecast health and safety compliance levels among staff and students at the Central University of Technology.

The analysis leverages historical institutional data, survey responses, and environmental factors to identify key behavioral and institutional drivers influencing compliance with safety policies and regulations. Using SAS Viya’s advanced statistical and modeling capabilities, data was cleaned, visualized, and analyzed to uncover hidden patterns and trends.

Multiple predictive models, including logistic regression, decision trees, and gradient boosting, were developed and compared using SAS Viya’s automated model comparison tools. The most accurate model was then used to predict compliance likelihood among different demographic and departmental groups.
